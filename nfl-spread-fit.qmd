Data files

```{r}
list_of_files <- list.files(path = "data",
                            recursive = TRUE,
                            pattern = "\\.csv$",
                            full.names = TRUE)  
```

Import data

```{r}
x <- read_csv(list_of_files, id = "file_name", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, "%m/%d/%Y"),
         betting_line = line) |> 
  mutate(score_line = home_score - visitor_score) |> 
  mutate(diff_line = abs(score_line - betting_line)) |> 
  select(- total_line)
```

Difference between game scores (score_line)) and spread (betting_line).

```{r}
obj_fit <- stan_glm(data = x,
         formula = betting_line ~ diff_line,
         family = gaussian,
         refresh = 0,
         seed = 9)
